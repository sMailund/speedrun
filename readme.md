# speedrun

A section of my commute has two diverging paths. This is a quick solution to figure out which of them is the fastest.

## how to use
Run `register_commute.py` and follow the prompts to register a commute. This will store the commute in the CSV file and commit the changes.

Run `fastest_commute.py` to run statistical analysis to figure out which of the two commutes are the fastest.
